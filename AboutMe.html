        <h2 class="Greeting">Happy Holidays!</h2>
        <p>If you see this message, this is my formal greeting to you of a Merry Christmas and happy holidays. I sure do hope you will continue to write down to me your experience with your holidays. Don't be shy as well to give or send photos to me since you know you know the channels you can reach me by. This website is my attempt to continue learning my understanding of the CSS aspect of web development and I try to use as much of its features as I possibly could. I hope this is some form of eye candy to you however. The pixel art shown in the first page is made from scratch using divs and the box-shadow element in CSS.</p>
        <p class="signature">With Love, Charles</p>
